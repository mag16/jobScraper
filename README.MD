Step-by-Step Instructions:
Clone or Download the Repository:

Clone the repository containing the scraping script and HTML file to your local machine, or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Open a command line interface (Command Prompt, Terminal, etc.).
Use the cd command to navigate to the project directory where the script (jobScraper.js) and HTML file (index.html) are located.
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required dependencies (Puppeteer and xlsx):
bash
Copy code
npm install puppeteer xlsx
Run the Scraping Script:

Execute the scraping script (jobScraper.js) using Node.js. This will fetch job postings from LinkedIn and Indeed, filter them based on your criteria, and save the results to a JSON file (job_results.json).
bash
Copy code
node jobScraper.js
Ensure that you replace 'INDEED_URL' and 'LINKEDIN_URL' in the script with the actual URLs of the job search results on Indeed and LinkedIn.

Open the HTML Page:

Open the HTML page (index.html) in a web browser to view the job results.
bash
Copy code
open index.html   # For Mac
start index.html  # For Windows
Alternatively, you can navigate to the project directory in your file explorer and double-click on the index.html file to open it in your default web browser.

View Job Results:

The HTML page will display two tables, one for LinkedIn jobs and one for Indeed jobs, based on the filtered results from the JSON file.
Automate Script Execution (Optional):

If you want to automate the script to run regularly, you can use a task scheduler (Windows) or a cron job (Unix-based systems) to execute the node jobScraper.js command at scheduled intervals.
Note: Ensure that web scraping is done responsibly and in compliance with the terms of service of the websites being scraped. Frequent scraping may lead to IP blocking or other restrictions.
